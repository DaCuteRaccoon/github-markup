== Text Formatting

=== Headers
ASCIIDoc headers can be written in two ways: with differing underlines or with different indentation using = (equals sign). ASCIIDoc supports headings 1-4. The editor will automatically use the = notation. To create a level one header, prefix your line with one =. Level two headers are created with == and so on.

=== Bold / Italic
To display text as bold, wrap the text in * (asterisks). To display text as italic, wrap the text in _ (underscores). To create monospace text, wrap the text in + (plus signs).

=== Scripts
Superscript and subscript is created the same way as other inline formats. To create superscript text, wrap your text in ^ (carats). To create subscript text, wrap your text in ~ (tildes).

=== Special Characters
+ASCIIDoc will automatically convert textual representations of commonly-used special characters. For example, (R) becomes ®, (C) becomes © and (TM) becomes ™.+
