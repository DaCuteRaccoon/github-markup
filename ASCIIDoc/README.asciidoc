== Text Formatting

=== Headers
ASCIIDoc headers can be written in two ways: with differing underlines or with different indentation using = (equals sign). ASCIIDoc supports headings 1-4. The editor will automatically use the = notation. To create a level one header, prefix your line with one =. Level two headers are created with == and so on.

=== Bold / Italic
To display text as bold, wrap the text in * (asterisks). To display text as italic, wrap the text in _ (underscores). To create monospace text, wrap the text in + (plus signs).

=== Scripts
Superscript and subscript is created the same way as other inline formats. To create superscript text, wrap your text in ^ (carats). To create subscript text, wrap your text in ~ (tildes).

=== Special Characters
ASCIIDoc will automatically convert textual representations of commonly-used special characters. For example, +(R)+ becomes ®, +(C)+ becomes © and +(TM)+ becomes ™.



== Blocks

=== Paragraphs
ASCIIDoc allows paragraphs to have optional titles or icons to denote special sections. To make a normal paragraph, simply add a line between blocks and a new paragraph will start. If you want to title your paragraphs, add a line prefixed by . (full stop). An example paragraph with optional title is displayed below:

```asciidoc
.Optional Title

This is my paragraph. It is two sentences long.
```

=== Source Blocks
To create source blocks (long blocks of code), follow the same syntax as above but with an extra line denoting the inline source and lines of four dashes (+----+) delimiting the source block.. An example of Python source is below:

```asciidoc
.python.py
[source,python]
----
# i just wrote a comment in python
# and maybe one more
----
```

=== Comment Blocks
Comment blocks are useful if you want to keep notes for yourself inline but do not want them displayed to the public. To create a comment block, simply wrap the paragraph in dividers with four slashes (+////+). An example comment block is below:

```asciidoc
////
My comment block is here now

It can be multiple paragraphs. Really.
////
```

=== Quote Blocks
Quote blocks work much like comment blocks — simply create dividers using four underscores (+____+) around your quote. An example quote block is displayed below:

```asciidoc
____
This is my quote block. Quote something nice here, otherwise there is no point in quoting.
____
```



== Macros

=== Links
To create links to external pages, you can simply write the URI if you want the URI to link to itself. (i.e., `+https://github.com/+` will automatically be parsed to https://github.com/. If you want different text to be displayed, simply append it to the end of the URI in between +[ (brackets.)+ For example, `+https://github.com/[GitHub]+` will be parsed as https://github.com/[GitHub], with the URI pointing to `+https://github.com+`.

=== Images
Images in ASCIIDoc work much like hyperlinks, but image URLs are prefixed with image`:`. For example, to link to an image at `images/icons/home.png`, write `image:images/icons/home.png`. Alt text can be added by appending the text to the URI in [ (brackets).
